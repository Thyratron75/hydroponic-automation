The goal of this research project was to design, build, and test a low-cost prototype system to automate and control critical variables of the environment in a containerized hydroponic garden. Optimizing the production of hydroponic shipping container systems for cost-efficiency and ease of operation could revitalize the health of low-income and urban communities located in food deserts. With these systems, communities would have close access to healthier, more natural food options year-round.  By creating simple technology that optimizes plant yield at the lowest cost, more research can be conducted to study the potential of hydroponics to improve environmental sustainability and end hunger, locally and abroad.  This project used Arduino microcontroller technology and an array of sensors to measure pH, conductivity, temperature, and oxygen levels of the nutrient solution; temperature, humidity and CO2 levels in the air; and the photosynthetically active radiation of the lights. The data compiled by the system is uploaded to the Internet, where it can be viewed remotely.  Conductivity, pH, and dissolved oxygen levels can be monitored and regulated continuously without human intervention. The completed system has the potential to control the environment at a substantially lower cost than most commercially available equipment on the market.  More information can be found in the final report located in the documentation folder.
